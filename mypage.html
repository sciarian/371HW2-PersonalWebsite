     I like to the exercise, code, read, and play the dark souls. In 
     my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. When I am not in class
     studying computer science one of my favorite things todo is exercise to destress. My goto
     form of exercise is running/jogging. I love to run. No matter where I am at I can always 
     throw on my running shoes and shorts and go for a quick jog to get my heart pumping and
     a quick endorphin rush. While I do enjoy the occasional jog with a friend, running for the 
     most part of me is a solo activity. It is valuable me time for me to decompress. But I do
     prefer the social aspect of partipating in athletic and recreational clubs. Sine my 
     freshman year I have participated in plethora of athletic clubs such as swimming, rock 
     climbing, fencing, running, and recently I have been trying out the boxing club and so far
     I have been really enjoying it.
     When I am not exercising a love a good book. My reading interests go all over the place 
     the Harry Potter series to War and Peace (I have yet to read the latter but hope to some 
     day!). Recently I have been a self improvement kick and I been gone through a bunch of 
     great books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear, The Sublte Art of not Giving a Fuck by 
     Mark Manson, and currenty I have been going through Seven Habits of Highly Effective
     People by Stephen Covey and so far my mind has been blown about every five pages.
     Like any Computer Science major I love video games, and one of my favorites since 
     highschool has been the Dark Souls series. I was drawn into the game by its reputation
     of being one of the most challenging experiences a gamer can find in this day and age of 
     video gaming. Upon starting the game I not only found it to be one of the most rewarding 
     challenges I have ever experienced in a video game, it's gameplay, setting, just enough
     rpg elements and delightfully convoluted and speculative in game story 
     has kept me coming back to it again and again for almost 5 years and I don't see myself 
     stopping anytime soon.
